## Useful Laziness

1. Consider the end goal and ask yourself - what is the appropriate level of detail here required to accomplish the goal?
2. Think of work in terms of magnitude - can I accomplish my goal with a quick stab at it? Or do I need something incredibly thorough. And what is the cost of doing something simple to start?
3. Format. What is the format I’m using to deliver the message? And could something be done more efficiently? Would an email be faster here? Would a phone call? If writing something, how do I dress up or dress down the output so that my writing is perceived in the right way?
4. Is this work being dictated by me or someone else? If its on their terms, how can I make it on my terms? Whats the simplest thing I can deliver to satisfy their goal?
5. Feelings - given I’m short on time, what is the simplest thing I can do to create a sense of progress? What can I do to create momentum or the feeling or momentum in the other party?
6. Activation energy and the subconscious. If I don’t want to do something, its probably because I’m overwhelmed by it. How can I take a time boxed 25 minutes to start on it. And promise myself I’ll stop at the 25 minute mark. Then let the subconscious take over.
7. Ultimately, never do any more work than you need to. But also never do any less. Find the right amount by shaping the work to be done, by managing expectations of and around the work and by doing things on your terms. All of this is a form of self respect in order to maximize time and be productive.
